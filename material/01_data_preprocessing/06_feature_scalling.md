# 📌 Feature Scaling in Machine Learning

## 📖 Introduction
Feature scaling is an essential preprocessing step in Machine Learning. It ensures that numerical features have the same scale, preventing certain features from dominating others and improving model performance.

## 🏗️ Why Use Feature Scaling?
- **Improves model performance**: Some algorithms (e.g., Gradient Descent, KNN, SVM) are sensitive to feature magnitudes.
- **Speeds up convergence**: Scaling helps optimization algorithms reach minima faster.
- **Prevents dominance of large values**: Features with larger scales won’t overshadow smaller ones.

## 🚀 Common Feature Scaling Techniques
### 1️⃣ Standardization (Z-score Normalization)
Standardization transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```
✅ Best for: Algorithms assuming normally distributed data (e.g., Linear Regression, SVM, PCA)

### 2️⃣ Min-Max Scaling (Normalization)
Min-max scaling rescales features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1].
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```
✅ Best for: Neural networks and distance-based models (e.g., KNN, K-Means, Deep Learning)

### 3️⃣ Robust Scaling
Robust scaling uses the median and interquartile range, making it less sensitive to outliers.
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler

scaler = RobustScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```
✅ Best for: Datasets with extreme outliers

### 4️⃣ Normalization (L1 & L2)
Normalization scales each feature vector so that its magnitude is 1 (useful for sparse datasets).
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer

scaler = Normalizer()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```
✅ Best for: Text classification and sparse data (e.g., NLP, TF-IDF)
